The Battle of Ushan, also known as the First Battle of Ushant, occurred during the American Revolutionary War between French and British fleets. On July 9th, HMS Victory under Admiral Keppel sailed with a fleet of 30 ships, spotting the French fleet on July 23rd. The battle saw tactical shifts and damage to both sides, but French escaped under night cover. The Trial of Viscount Keppel followed in 1778, arising from the battle's aftermath, involving accusations between Keppel and Admiral Palliser. Both were acquitted, but the trial strained the British Navy and stirred public and political controversies.
