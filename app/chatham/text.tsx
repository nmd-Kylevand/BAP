    The HMS Victory was ordered by the British Admiralty to be built as a 100-gun first-rate ship of the line. The ship, designed by naval architect Sir Thomas Slade, began construction at the Chatham Dockyard.

    Around 6000 trees were used for the construction of the hull which is equivalent to 60 acres of forest. Amounting to a total of £63,176 (over £50 million today).
    It was an unpopular decision among sailors to name the ship Victory as the previous ship which had that name sunk with all on board in the English channel, 25 year before the Victory.
    On 7 may 1765 the Victory was finally launched, but it wasn’t until 13 years later that it would see its first active service in the War of American Independence (1775-83). Due to its excellent design of the underwater hull, the Victory would prove itself successful in sailing faster than many of its smaller consorts.
