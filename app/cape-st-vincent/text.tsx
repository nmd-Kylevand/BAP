export default`The Battle of Cape St. Vincent on February 14, 1797, was a key naval engagement in the French Revolutionary Wars near Cape St. Vincent. Admiral John Jervis led the British Royal Navy with HMS Victory, facing Admiral José de Córdoba's Spanish fleet. The Spanish fleet (24 ships) aimed to protect a convoy to Cádiz, but Admiral Jervis (15 British ships) intercepted them. At 11 AM, Jervis signals 'Form a battle line near Victory.' The British line sails south between Spanish columns. At 11:12 AM, Jervis orders 'Engage the enemy.' At 11:30 AM, Jervis signals intent to pass through enemy lines, exploiting their split formation. At 12:08 PM, the British fleet tacks to attack the Spanish leeward side. HMS Victory's 104 guns were heavily used, notably against the 112-gun Principe de Asturias. The latter suffered damage due to the admiral's hesitation, receiving broadsides from Victory. The battle resulted in British losses of 73 dead, 327 wounded. Spanish losses: 4 ships, 250 dead, 550 wounded, 3000 captured.`
